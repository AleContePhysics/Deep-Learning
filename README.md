# Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) - Work in Progress

This repository contains the ongoing development of my final project for the Deep Learning course. 

### Summary
The objective is to implement a Wasserstein GAN, first tested on the MNIST dataset and then applied to generate synthetic financial time series.

### Current Status
*   **WGAN Architecture:** Implemented and functional.
*   **MNIST Training:** Completed.
*   **Financial Application:** Completed.
*   **Report:** Work in progress. 

### Contents
`WGAN_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the abstract,implementation, training scripts, and preliminary results.
